    detailedCritique:
      'First Past The Post (FPTP) is the most widely used voting system globally, where voters select one candidate and the candidate with the most votes wins. While its simplicity makes it easy to understand and implement, FPTP suffers from severe limitations that can undermine democratic representation. The system is highly susceptible to vote splitting, where similar candidates divide their shared voter base, potentially allowing a less popular candidate to win. This creates the spoiler effect, forcing voters to strategically vote for a "lesser evil" rather than their true preference. FPTP tends to produce two-party dominance over time, as voters abandon third parties to avoid wasting their votes. In multi-candidate races, winners can have surprisingly low vote shares - sometimes under 30% - meaning the majority of voters preferred someone else. The system also leads to gerrymandering concerns and can produce highly disproportionate results when used for legislative elections.',

    shortDescription: 'Approve any number of candidates',
    detailedCritique:
      "Approval Voting represents a minimal yet powerful reform to plurality voting, allowing voters to select as many candidates as they approve of, with the candidate receiving the most approvals winning. This elegantly simple change eliminates the spoiler effect entirely - voters can support both their favorite candidate and a more viable alternative without harming either. The system encourages honest voting since supporting additional candidates never hurts those you've already selected. Studies and real-world implementations show Approval Voting tends to elect broadly acceptable consensus candidates rather than polarizing figures. It requires no new voting equipment, as it uses the same ballots as plurality voting. The main limitation is the lack of preference expression - you cannot indicate that you prefer one approved candidate over another. However, this simplicity is also a strength, making the system transparent and easy to understand. Approval Voting has been successfully used by the UN, various professional societies, and the cities of Fargo and St. Louis.",

    detailedCritique:
      'Instant Runoff Voting (IRV), also called Ranked Choice Voting (RCV) or Alternate Vote (AV, in the UK). Allows voters to rank candidates in order of preference. If no candidate receives a majority of first-choice votes, the candidate with the fewest votes is eliminated and their voters\' ballots are transferred to their next choice. This process continues until someone has a majority. While IRV does eliminate the most basic spoiler effects between similar candidates, it suffers from several paradoxes that can produce counterintuitive results. The system can eliminate centrist candidates who would beat any other candidate head-to-head (the "center squeeze" problem), and in some cases, getting more first-choice votes can actually cause a candidate to lose (non-monotonicity). IRV is also vulnerable to strategic voting - "bullet voting" (only ranking one candidate) can sometimes help your favorite candidate. The sequential elimination process makes results difficult to predict and can take days to tabulate in close races. Despite these flaws, IRV does ensure majority support (among remaining candidates) and allows voters to express preferences.',
