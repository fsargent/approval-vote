# Approval.Vote

A website that visualizes and analyzes Approval Voting election results. View it at [approval.vote](https://approval.vote).

## About

Approval.Vote provides detailed reports and visualizations for Approval Voting elections, where voters can select multiple candidates and the candidate with the most votes wins. The site features:

- **Vote Count Visualizations**: Bar charts showing candidate support
- **Co-Approval Analysis**: Matrix showing how often voters approved candidate pairs together
- **Voting Pattern Analysis**: Distribution of how many candidates voters approved
- **Cast Vote Record Processing**: Tools to parse and analyze raw ballot data

The site is built with SvelteKit and hosted on GitHub Pages.

## Development

### Prerequisites

- [mise](https://mise.jdx.dev/) for environment management
- [trunk](https://trunk.io) for linting and formatting

### Setup

1. Install mise and trunk:

   ```bash
   # macOS
   brew install mise trunk-io

   # Other platforms: see mise.jdx.dev and trunk.io
   ```

2. Set up development environment:

   ```bash
   mise install    # Installs Node.js 20
   trunk install   # Installs linters and formatters
   npm ci         # Installs dependencies
   ```

3. Start development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

### Code Quality

We use trunk.io for consistent code quality:

```bash
trunk check    # Run all linters
trunk fmt      # Format all files
```

## Building

Create a production build:

```bash
npm run build    # Generate static site
npm run preview  # Preview the production build
```

## Contributing Election Data

The election data is stored in `data.sqlite3`. There are two ways to add election data:

### Manual Data Entry

1. Fork this repository
2. Add your election data to `load-report.js`
3. Run the script to update `data.sqlite3`
4. Submit a pull request

### Cast Vote Record Processing

For elections with detailed ballot data:

1. Use the `st-louis-cvr/` tools to parse CVR files into SQLite
2. Generate co-approval matrices and voting pattern analysis
3. Export the processed data to the main `data.sqlite3` database
4. The website automatically displays the rich analysis features

See the `st-louis-cvr/README.md` for detailed instructions.

## Deployment

The site automatically deploys to GitHub Pages when changes are merged to the main branch. The deployment process:

1. Generates card images using Puppeteer
2. Builds the static site
3. Deploys to GitHub Pages
